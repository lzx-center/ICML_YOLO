abstract="In recent years, the study of adversarial robustness in object detection systems, particularly those based on deep neural networks (DNNs), has become a pivotal area of research. Traditional physical attacks targeting object detectors, such as adversarial patches and texture manipulations, directly manipulate the surface of the object. While these methods are effective, their overt manipulation of objects may draw attention in real-world applications. To address this, this paper introduces a more subtle approach: an inconspicuous adversarial trigger that operates outside the bounding boxes, rendering the object undetectable to the model. We further enhance this approach by proposing the Feature Guidance (FG) technique and the Universal Auto-PGD (UAPGD) optimization strategy for crafting high-quality triggers. The effectiveness of our method is validated through extensive empirical testing, demonstrating its high performance in both digital and physical environments.

abstract = {Neural networks are becoming increasingly prevalent in software, and it is therefore important to be able to verify their behavior. Because verifying the correctness of neural networks is extremely challenging, it is common to focus on the verification of other properties of these systems. One important property, in particular, is robustness. Most existing definitions of robustness, however, focus on the worst-case scenario where the inputs are adversarial. Such notions of robustness are too strong, and unlikely to be satisfied by---and verifiable for---practical neural networks. Observing that real-world inputs to neural networks are drawn from non-adversarial probability distributions, we propose a novel notion of robustness: probabilistic robustness, which requires the neural network to be robust with at least (1 - 'e) probability with respect to the input distribution. This probabilistic approach is practical and provides a principled way of estimating the robustness of a neural network. We also present an algorithm, based on abstract interpretation and importance sampling, for checking whether a neural network is probabilistically robust. Our algorithm uses abstract interpretation to approximate the behavior of a neural network and compute an overapproximation of the input regions that violate robustness. It then uses importance sampling to counter the effect of such overapproximation and compute an accurate estimate of the probability that the neural network violates the robustness property.},

abstract = {Most deep neural network (DNN) verification research focuses on qualitative verification, which answers whether or not a DNN violates a safety/robustness property. This paper proposes an approach to convert qualitative verification into quantitative verification for neural networks. The resulting quantitative verification method not only can answer YES or NO questions but also can compute the probability of a property being violated. To do that, we introduce the concept of a probabilistic star (or shortly ProbStar), a new variant of the well-known star set, in which the predicate variables belong to a Gaussian distribution and propose an approach to compute the probability of a probabilistic star in high-dimensional space. Unlike existing works dealing with constrained input sets, our work considers the input set as a truncated multivariate normal (Gaussian) distribution, i.e., besides the constraints on the input variables, the input set has a probability of the constraints being satisfied. The input distribution is represented as a probabilistic star set and is propagated through a network to construct the output reachable set containing multiple ProbStars, which are used to verify the safety or robustness properties of the network. In case of a property is violated, the violation probability can be computed precisely by an exact verification algorithm or approximately by an overapproximate verification algorithm. The proposed approach is implemented in a tool named StarV and is evaluated using the well-known ACASXu networks and a rocket landing benchmark.},

title = {Probability and Computing: Randomization and Probabilistic Techniques in Algorithms and Data Analysis},
year = {2017},
isbn = {110715488X},
publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
address = {USA},
edition = {2nd},
abstract = {Greatly expanded, this new edition requires only an elementary background in discrete mathematics and offers a comprehensive introduction to the role of randomization and probabilistic techniques in modern computer science. Newly added chapters and sections cover topics including normal distributions, sample complexity, VC dimension, Rademacher complexity, power laws and related distributions, cuckoo hashing, and the Lovasz Local Lemma. Material relevant to machine learning and big data analysis enables students to learn modern techniques and applications. Among the many new exercises and examples are programming-related exercises that provide students with excellent training in solving relevant problems. This book provides an indispensable teaching tool to accompany a one- or two-semester course for advanced undergraduate students in computer science and applied mathematics.}
